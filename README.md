## üõ§Ô∏è London Tube AI Search Algorithms

In this repository, we have leveraged the power of artificial intelligence and search algorithms to solve the problem of navigating the complex London Tube Map efficiently. By employing algorithms like DFS, BFS, UCS, and Heuristics, we can find optimal routes, minimize travel time, and make informed decisions when traveling on the London Tube network.

## üß≠ Understanding the Algorithms

### Depth-First Search (DFS)
DFS is a traversal algorithm that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. In the context of the London Tube Map, DFS can help us find a route by systematically exploring each possible path until the destination is reached.

### Breadth-First Search (BFS)
BFS explores all the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level. This strategy ensures that we find the shortest path first, making it a useful algorithm for route planning on the London Tube network.

### Uniform Cost Search (UCS)
UCS is a search algorithm used for traversing weighted graphs and finding the optimal path based on the cost of each edge. In the context of the London Tube Map, UCS can help us identify the most cost-effective route considering factors like distance or time.

### Heuristic Search
Heuristic search algorithms incorporate domain-specific knowledge to guide the search process more efficiently. By using heuristics, we can make informed decisions about which paths to explore first, improving the overall search performance on the London Tube Map.
